# CaveResourceFix

This is a tool for Wurm Unlimited
[made by BuddaT](https://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/153821-caveresourcefix-fix-your-cave-maps-that-have-resource-counts-set-to-~50-for-non-vein-tiles/),
used to force sandstone veins to contain normal vein amounts of shards, rather than the amount rocks have on the server.

It is no longer available at the original place it was posted, so this repo contains the [original jar](./CaveResourceFix-original.jar),
along with the source code posted on the forum, and under the releases page the jar compiled by me. I have changed nothing.
